This is chemical balancer. Enter your chemical equation without indices and program will place them for you.

main.py and main2.py are the main files to run the program.
test.py and test2.py are the files with some testable equation.

There are two solution methods.
1. main.py and test.py have the same solution method.
2. main2.py and test2.py have the same solution method.


How to write chemical equation:

Only the first letter of the element should be capitalized:
He, Li, Be, Ne, Na, Mg

Template:
(reactant 1) + (reactant 2) + ... + (reactant n) = (product 1) + (product 2) + ... + (product n)

Example:
Na3PO4 + MgCl2 = NaCl + Mg3(PO4)2
