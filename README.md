This is chemical balancer. Enter your chemical equation without indices and program will place them for you.

main.py and main2.py are the main files to run the program.
test.py and test2.py are the files with some testable equation.

There are two solution methods.
1. main.py and test.py have the same solution method.(not working)
2. main2.py and test2.py have the same solution method.(recomended to use)


How to write chemical equation:

Only the first letter of the element should be capitalized:
He, Li, Be, Ne, Na, Mg

You do not need to write coefficients.
You must write the subscript as a regular number (without parentheses) to the right of the element:
H2, O2, CO2

Example:
Na3PO4 + MgCl2 = NaCl + Mg3(PO4)2


There is also a code to solve polynomial equations. You can see it in the file called equation_solver.py. You also need to install library matplotlib for it.

You can also find file named One_for_All.py. If you run it you will see the menu in which you can choose which file to run out of equation_solver.py, main2.py, and test2.py.
